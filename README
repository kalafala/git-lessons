To seed initial project directory
---------------------------------
git init
git add .
git commit
Note git "commit -a" does both commit and add

Use "git status" to check status of current directory, 
When making any changes:
	git add <filename>
	git commit

Use "git log" to list versions
Use "git checkout <unique portion of character code>" to check out a particular version, or "git checkout master" to checkout the latest version.
Use "git revert HEAD" to backout last change, OR "git revert HEAD-N" to revert changes specified by the N+1th last change.

Branching
---------
Use "git checkout -B <new branchname>" to create a new branch
	- Will need to git add, git commit any changes
Use "git branch" to list branches, highlighting current branch
Use "git checkout <branchname>" to switch branches
Use "git merge <branch-to-merge-in-to-this>" to merge <branch-to-merge..> in to current active branch
e.g,
	git checkout mybranch
	git merge master <== merge updates in master in to mybranch

To use a remote repo
--------------------
(assuming a repo has been created on github)
git remote add origin https://github.com/kalafala/express-lessons
git remote -v 
(above is one-time step)

git push origin master
   OR
git push origin <branch name>
(each time we want to push to the server)

git pull origin <branch name>
(each time we want to pull from the server)

To deploy in another directory
------------------------------
mkdir <some new directory>
cd <some new directory>
git_clone <original repo> .

OR

git clone https://github.com/kalafala/express-lessons.git
	by default, above will create an express-lessons directory in pwd, if you want to specify a particular dir, just type that <dirname> after lessons.git above
	(above URL can be copied from github web interface)
